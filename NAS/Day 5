Corner stone of NN learning

It's an algorithm to reduce error. Mean of the errors!!

2D is a derivative or x and y

The gradient descent algorithm moves the parameters of learning machine against the direction of error gradient

 Regular neural networks:
	- System topology
	- Performance criterion
	- Adaptation algorithms

Neural Nets: Node architecture
Multi layer Neural nets

Bias variance dilemma

Temporal Neural Nets
