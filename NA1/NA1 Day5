Understanding Binaries

Notes:

Cyclic redundancy  check

R+1 pattern

D x 2 ^r  XOR  x R = nG

R = remainder x ( (D 2 ^r)/g))


Multiple access links, protocols

Two types of links
	- Point-to-point
	- Broadcast( shared wire or medium)
		○ HFC( hybrid fiber coaxial cable)- dailup

In single shared broadcast channel if two or more simultaneous transmissions by nodes: interference
	- Collision

Multiple access protocol
	- Distributed algorithm


An ideal multiple access protocol

Given: broadcast channel of rate R bps
Decided:

MAC protocols: taxanomy

Three classes:
	- Channel pratitioning
	- Random access
	- "Taking turns"

Channel partitioning MAC protocols: TDMA

TDMA: time division multiple access
Access to channel in round

FDMA: frequency division multiple access

Random access protocols

ALOHA: Additive Links On-line Hawaii Area.
Slotted ALOHA

Efficiency- calculation

P ( 1-p)^N-1

Max efficiency:= 1/e = .37

Pure(unslotted) ALOHA

Probability efficiency = 1/2e = .18

Worse than slotted ALOHA!

CSMA( carrier sense multiple access)
	Listen before transmit
	
CSMA collisions

NIC: network interface controller

CSMA/CD efficiency

Tprop
Ttrans

Efficiency = 1/(1+(5Tprop)/Ttrans))

Taking turns MAC protocols
	- Polling
	- Concerns:
		○ Polling overhead
		○ Latency
		○ Single point of failure(master)

Token passing:

Token passed from one node to next sequentially 
Concerns:
	- Token overhead
	- Latency
	- Single point of failure

Summary:
	- Channel partitioning
	- Random access
	- Taking turns
