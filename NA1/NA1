Transport layer:

Principles behind transport layer services:
	- Multiplexing,demultiplexing
	- Reliable data transfer
	- Flow control
	- Congestion control

TCP:
	- Reliable, in-order delivery
	- Congestion control
	- Flow control
	- Connection setup

UDP:
	- Unreliable, unordered delivery
	- No frills extension of "best -effort" IP


Demultiplexing
	- host uses IP address &port numbers to direct segment to appropriate socket

TCP socket identified by 4 tuple:
	- Source IP address
	- Source port number
	- Dest IP address
	- Dest port number

Demux: receiver uses all four values to direct segment to appropriate socket

UDP: User Datagram Protocol

	- No frills, bare bones
	- Best effort service, UDP segments may be:
		○ Lost
		○ Delivered out-of-order to app
	- Connectionless:
		○ No handshake between UDP sender, receiver
		○ Each UDP segment handled independently of others
UDP use:
	- Streaming multimedia apps
	- DNS
	- SNMP
	- HTTP/3

If reliable transfer needed over UDP:
	- Add needed reliability at application layer
	- Add congestion control at application layer

UDP checksum
Goal: detect errors in transmitted segment

Sender:
	- Treat contents of UDP segment as sequence of 16-bit integers
	- Checksum: addition of segment content
	- Checksum value
