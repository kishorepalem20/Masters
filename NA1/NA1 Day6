Wireless vs Mobility

Elements of a wireless network

Ad hoc mode

Wireless link characteristics

Difference from wired link
	- Decreased signal strength
	- Interference from other sources
	- Multipath propagation

IEEE 802.11 Wireless LAN

802.11b
802.11a
802.11g
802.11n

802.11 LAN architecture
	- Wireless host
	- Basic Service Set(BSS)

802.11 passive/active scanning

Passive scanning:
	- Beacon frames sent from Aps
Active scanning:
	- Probe request from broadcast from H1

Collision avoidance 

The "Hidden node" problem although A and C are hidden from each other, their signals can collide at B.

Multiple access with collision avoidance 

Key Idea:
	- Request to send(RTS)
	- Clear to send(CTS)
