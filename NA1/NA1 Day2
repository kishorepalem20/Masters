Outline

	- Applications
	- Requirements
	- Network architecture 
	- connectivity



Application Protocol

	- URL
	- HTTP
	- TCP


Internet structure: network of networks

Connectivity

	- Link
	- Nodes
	- Point-to-point
	- Multiple access
	- Switched network




Cost effective Resource sharing


Stastical Multiplexing

LAN, MAN, WAN, SAN

Common communication Patterns

	- Client


Practical issues- Reliability

Bits are lost
	- Bit errors( 1 to 0 and vice versa)
	- Burst errors - several consecutive errors
Packets are lost(congestion)
Links and nodes failures
Messages are delayed
Messages are delivered out-of-order

Protocols
	- Protocol defines the interfaces between the layers in the same system and with the layers of peer system

OSI model(Open system Interconnection)

Application
	- FTP,SMTP,HTTP
Presentation
	- 
Session
Transport
	- TCP,UDP
Network
	- IP, routing protocols
Data Link
	- Ethernet, 802.11(WiFi), PPP
Physical: bits on Wire

Internet Protocol Stack
	
	
Presentation: allows applications to interpret meaning of data,
E.g., encryption, compression, machine specific conventions
Session: synchronization of data

Packet switching: store and forward

2L/R with delay propagation

L=7.5 Mbit
R=1.5 Mbps

Two key netwrok-core functions
	- Routing
	- Forwarding 
Alternative: circuit switching

Circuit switching: FDM vs TDM

Packet switching vs circuit switching

Performance metrics
	- Delay
	- Bandwidth
	- Loss

Delay = Propagation + Transmit + Queue + processing 
	- Propagation = distance/speed of light
	- Transmit = size/bandwidth
 One bit Transmisson => propagation is important

D nodal = d proc + d queue + d trans + d prop

D proc: nodal processing
	- Check bit errors
	- Determine output link
	- Typical < msec

D queue: queueing delay
	- Time waiting at output link for transmission
	- Depends upon congestion level

D trans: transmission delay
L: packet length(bits)
R: link bandwith




Delay X Bandwidth
